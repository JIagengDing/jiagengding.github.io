OpenWRT is used for dialing and routing, allocated two CPUs and 1GB of memory, with a passthrough network port for WAN connection to the optical modem.
The Debian system is responsible for running most of the services I use daily, including providing DNS, RSS, and media services.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>R.I.P.

Recently, I configured Xray-core to access the internal network and decided to document the SSH configuration along the way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>P.S. In fact, using &lt;a href="https://www.wireguard.com">Wireguard&lt;/a> is a more elegant and secure solution, but Xray-core can simultaneously implement traffic routing, making it seem like the only choice.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title> Build Remote JupyterLab and Reverse Proxy by Nginx or Caddy</title><link>https://blog.diing.uk/en/post/jupyter/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Sep 2022 21:14:23 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://blog.diing.uk/en/post/jupyter/</guid><description/></item><item><title>How to use encrypted DNS</title><link>https://blog.diing.uk/en/post/doh/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Sep 2022 15:32:21 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://blog.diing.uk/en/post/doh/</guid><description>&lt;p>A simple guide about using encrypted dns in Linux、Mac、iOS and Android.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Traditional DNS queries and responses are sent over UDP or TCP without encryption. This is vulnerable to eavesdropping and spoofing (including DNS-based Internet filtering).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Encrypted DNS can make DNS queries and responses more safe.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dns Recommended</title><link>https://blog.diing.uk/en/post/dns/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Sep 2022 19:58:19 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://blog.diing.uk/en/post/dns/</guid><description>&lt;p>ipv4 ipv6 dot doh address for DNS&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Simple Guide for Git</title><link>https://blog.diing.uk/en/post/git-guide/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Oct 2021 11:06:21 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://blog.diing.uk/en/post/git-guide/</guid><description>&lt;p>Git is software for tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development.
